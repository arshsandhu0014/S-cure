                In the modern educational landscape, the holistic well-being of college students has emerged as a paramount concern, necessitating innovative approaches to healthcare delivery. The traditional model of healthcare provision, characterized by its centralized and often rigid structure, fails to adequately address the diverse needs and preferences of today's student population.
